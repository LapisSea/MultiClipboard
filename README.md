# Lapis clipboard manager
This is a random project that I felt like making. :P
It is a program that listens to your clipboard changes and stores it in multiple "slots" so you can use them when ever you need to.

When used the jar file should be placed in an empty folder so a few generated files will not be mixed with your other documents.

How to use: 
1. since the program has no UI there will be a file that you can delete to shut down the program without use of task manager.
2. when ran a json config file will be generated so you can customize how program looks and acts.
3. in the config you can look at the activation key and change it.
4. siwtch mode: false->hold acticvation key to show menu, true-> click acticvation key to turn on/off menu
